# Command-line Escape Room interface with locked commands üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: The One


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aidan Jaison - Muthoot Institute of Technology and Science

### Project Description
Here's a command line, but not your regular Linux command line. Here, you've to unlock each command. You can't just use the "cd" command or the "ls" command as you wish, you have to solve a riddle to be able to use those commands and finally escape the room. That doesn't mean that the AI would leave you alone easy, it would roast you for getting it wrong too.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The problem that didn't exist that I made up is that you can't easily access the command line and use it as you please. (Not making life any easier)

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
The solution that I proposed for the problem I created is that you've to manually earn the right to use each commands. You have to solve a riddle when you try to implement a command in your knowledge. The roasts by the AI will help you lighten up the mood and try again. Only by solving the riddle can you use the command in the command line interface and escape the room.
